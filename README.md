# UPA
UPA project

## Data downloader
- the module downloads the data and stores it in the "data" folder.
- Then we need another module to open these files and parse them into a database.
### How to run the code
- There are some modules that need to be installed if the user does not have them, e.g. beautifulsoup4.
- simply: `python3 main.py` or `make`
- to clean up the project, type `make clean`
